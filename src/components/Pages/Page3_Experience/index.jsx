                    <p>Over the past 3-4 months I have fully engulfed myself within the software development world and now I have a number of projects that showcase the skills I have gathered during my time at General Assembly. My passion for software development started off in college where i became a tutor for embedded systems programming using C language.</p>

                    <h1 className="text-2xl pb-5 bold underline">Controls Engineer</h1>
                    <p>I have a very extensive background with PLC controls primarily using Allen Bradley (RS-Logix 500 / 5000), TIA portal (V13-V17), Simatic S7 and Fanuc robotics. Typically the machines i programmed would consist of 100-200 remote I/0 and would have 5-15 servo motors using S120 drives for siemens and kinetix 5700 drives for AB (Also used kinetix 6000 and 6500).</p>

                    <p>Although i have only 1-2 years of electrical engineering i have learned a tremendous amount. Not only in theoretical calculations but with overall design standards and practices. Most of my experience has been using E-Plan but i have done some engineering using Auto-CAD. During my short stint of designed i have taken course giving me certificates for UL standard and E-plan.</p>

                    <p>Of course with all aspects of the controls or electrical engineering field one must have a hands on knowledge in order to design a product. For me i have been doing panel wiring, extensive electrical diagnostics and machine installation wiring for atleast 8 years. Although it can challenging at times i throughly enjoy solving any circuit problems.</p>
